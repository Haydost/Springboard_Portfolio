    "        - Permutation sampling will be used here to test if males/females come from the same distribution with regards to the amount of change observed\n",
    "    - Which biomarkers show a statistically significant change as a person develops AD?\n",
    "    - In biomarkers that show a change, what amount of change is correlated with progression towards AD?\n",
    "- Biomarker baseline values as predictors of AD\n",
    "    - Are there statistically significant thresholds for baseline values of a biomarker that suggest a person will develop AD?\n",
    "        - How does this vary when including/excluding certain diagnosis groups?\n",

    "            3. Including only patients that were CN at baseline\n",

    "    - Clinical tests: CDRSB, ADAS11, ADAS13, MMSE, RAVLT_immediate\n",
    "    - Brain scans: Hippocampus, Ventricles, WholeBrain, Entorhinal MidTemp\n",
    "- Approach\n",
    "    - As sample sizes are not very large, bootstrapping will be used to generate a distribution for the change in each biomarker for patients that showed no change in diagnosis during the study\n",
    "    - The null hypothesis is that when patients are divided into groups based on their change in diagnosis (CN to MCI, MCI to AD, CN to AD) all groups will have the same distribution as the group that ended the study with no change\n",
    "        - May have to examine whether patients with no change in diagnosis that are not CN (MCI to MCI and AD to AD) impact the results\n",
    "    - The alternative hypothesis is that the distributions for each group will be different enough that threshold values can be identified to signify beginning early treatment for MCI/AD or raising concerns about progression to AD\n",
    "        - A 'statistically significant' result of p < 0.05 is not necessarily needed to indicate that a change in a biomarker can be used to initiate early treatment, further monitoring, or further testing\n",
    "        - Instead, this analysis is looking for probability levels that show reasons for actions\n",
    "            - If someone told you that you had an 80% chance of developing AD, would you start doing brain exercises and puzzles, painting, or listening to classical music if you thought it might help at all?"
